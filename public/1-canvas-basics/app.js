//Part 1: Append a <canvas> element under <div id='plot1'> with the same width and height as the container element
//Store drawing context as a variable
//Hint: use canvas.getContext('2d');


//Part 2: Draw a gray background, with fillStyle = 'rgb(250,250,250)'


//Part 3: Draw a x and y grid, spaced 50px apart, with strokeStyle = 'rgb(180,180,180)'
//Hint: use context2D.beginPath and context2D path commands within two for... loops


//Part 4: Draw a filled red rectangle at (50,50), with width = 50 and height = 50
//Draw a rectangle with red border at (150,50), with width = 50 and height = 50
//Hint: use context2D.fillRect and context2D.strokeRect


// Part 5: Draw a series of circles and lines using the context2D path commands, as shown


// Part 6: Label each circle with coordinates
// Hint: context2D.fillText


// Part 7: append a new <canvas> element under <div id='plot2'>, and copy the content of the first canvas onto it
